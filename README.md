This is created to learn GitHub

I am writting this to understand about the commits and braches ! I have written this in another branch called readme-edits. This is different from master branch, so if I am not wrong, I should not see all this in Master branch untill i commit these changes to master (or do something else i dont know yet :|)  Anyways ! Lets see how it works :)

Happy Gitting :D
